<hr><h2>What is CQL</h2>

<p>CQL is a schema definition and data query language.</p>

<p>Because it is built on the latest parsing algorithms it is able to read much like natural language while still being formally specified.
For instance (a super trivial example):</p>

<pre>
Family Name is written as String(20);
Given Names is written as String(20);
Family is identified by its Name;
Person is identified by Family and Given Names where
    Person is of one Family,
    Family includes Person,
    Person has one Given Names;
</pre>

<p>This is just natural enough that you can collaborate directly with domain experts.
Instead of translating their description of the model into SQL you can collaborate directly on the model.
</p>

<hr><h2>About the author</h2>

<p>
I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danielrheath">@danielrheath</a> and I <a href="http://danielrheath.net/">write about tech occasionally</a>.
I didn't create ActiveFacts but I do think it's pretty cool.
Feel free to get in touch; I don't bite.
</p>

<hr><h2>Installing</h2>

<p>
Installing is simple if you are familiar with ruby; <code>gem install activefacts</code> will do (although releases are somewhat infrequent, so running from <a href="https://github.com/cjheath/activefacts">master</a> - perhaps <a href="http://gembundler.com/git.html">via bundler</a> might be a better option).
I find guard useful (gem install activefacts-guard doesn't work yet but I plan to write it...)
TODO: Add a link to a near-empty project with a working guardfile - maybe the master branch of this repo?
</p>

<hr><p>
TODO: Show an example of loading &amp; using a CQL file from ruby directly.
